## The Escape for A77
Program your way to freedom! Trapped in an intergalactic space prison with nothing but an alien computer and a curious wookie companion, you will have to solve a series of programming puzzles on an unfamiliar computing architecture to escape confinement on the asteroid prison A77.

The Escape from A77 is a puzzle game about programming a computer which isn't quite like those on earth. On earth, a computer can access any part of its memory at any time, but on this intergalactic space computer, memory is spatial!

The Escape from A77 is played in a custom Assembly language which we have implemented. It compiles down to instructions for this virtual machine, which are all designed around modifying the computer's spatial memory. Memory is organized as a graph of nodes, and a program may only access memory which is directly adjacent to its last access, and may only visit a single node at a time.
With these alien restrictions, The Escape from A77 provides an opportunity to solve familiar programming problems on an unfamiliar computing platform - a series of 6 satisfying challenges to test your programming prowess and escape intergalactic jail at the same time!
